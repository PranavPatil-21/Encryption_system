# Encryption_system
**Chaos based encryption system using Double Pendulum**<br><br>
<i>Purpose of the project :</i> <br><br>
The present era of information and data gives us an enormous amount of opportunities
for data transfer, data storage, and analysis of sensitive data. This also exposes us to
many cyber-attacks and issues related to confidentiality, data privacy, authentication,
and other such risky events.
To address these issues, data is encrypted before storing or communicating to reduce
data-related security issues. Currently, data storage can be done by encrypting the data
with an AES encryption system. There are other methods too.
In the system, we aim to focus on the problem of encryption for data that is supposed
to be stored and read by only authorized personnel. The current process of generating
the master key in the AES encryption system is pseudo-random. The method we aim to
build should increase the randomness of the master key or round key generation, which
the AES uses. This will increase the cryptanalysis time by a considerable amount for
already difficult AES systems.<br> <br>
